# Global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) & CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Data Pipeline üåç 

## Overview

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions‚Äîespecially carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)‚Äîbeing a major driver of rising global temperatures. Understanding emission trends is critical for policymakers, researchers, and sustainability leaders aiming to mitigate climate change and develop effective carbon reduction strategies.

## Problem Statement: The Climate Challenge

Greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), are major contributors to climate change. Human activities like fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and agriculture have significantly increased CO‚ÇÇ emissions, driving global warming and its associated impacts. These include:

- **Rising Global Temperatures**: A 1.1¬∞C increase since pre-industrial times, with potential catastrophic effects.
- **Extreme Weather Events**: Intensified hurricanes, floods, and droughts affecting vulnerable regions.
- **Health Risks**: Air pollution causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
- **Economic & Social Disruptions**: Costing billions globally, with developing nations most affected.

### Key Research Questions

- How have global CO‚ÇÇ emissions changed over time?
- Which countries and regions contribute the most to emissions?
- What sectors and sources drive emissions the most?
- How do per-capita emissions compare across countries?

## Objectives

This project aims to automate the ingestion, processing, and analysis of CO‚ÇÇ & GHG emissions data to provide actionable insights for climate action, by examining trends in global CO‚ÇÇ emissions over time to understand the scale and direction of the issue and identifying some key contributors to CO‚ÇÇ emissions, such as countries and industries, and assess their roles in climate change.

- Automate data ingestion of global emissions dataset using Kestra.
- Process large-scale datasets efficiently with PySpark.
- Store structured data in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and BigQuery for analytics.
- Transform raw data into insightful models using DBT.
- Enable interactive visualizations with Power BI / Metabase.

## Data Source

This project uses the  CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset provided by [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data). You can find out more about the dataset and related metadata from the [codebook](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-codebook.csv) provided. It includes a description and source for each indicator in the dataset.

Special thanks to them for making this valuable data publicly available. You can explore more such dataset on their [website](https://ourworldindata.org/).
